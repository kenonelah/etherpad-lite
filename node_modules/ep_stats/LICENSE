#Commercial license.  OH noes..
-------------------------------

I am a core Etherpad contributor and have written 50+ open source Etherpad plugins, this is NOT an open source plugin.  Sorry!  I know it sucks so this plugin is under a hungry developer license

## What is the hungry developer license?
Sometimes a developer will self fund a plugin and release it under a commercial license.  That's what happened here.

## Why am I releasing this as a commercial plugin?
The implementation cost and time for this plugin was vast.  I need to recoup some of my costs.

## Pricing
The fee is $400 for each Etherpad instance.  An instance is defined as each node thread.  Not for profit (explicit not for profit = 801c3 or equivalent registration) pricing is $40.

## Redistribution
This code should not be implemented or redistriuted without express permission.

## Warranty
The warranty provided with this code is extremely limited, if it doesn't work for you, you have two options:
1) Pay an hourly rate of 80$ to fix the plugin.
2) Ask me for a refund within 30 days of purchase.
