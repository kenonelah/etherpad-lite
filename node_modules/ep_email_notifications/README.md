# Description
This plugin allows users to subscribe to pads and receive email updates when a pad is being modified.  You can modify the frequency.  This plugin is still in early stage and has things TODO (See TODO).

# Source code
On Github : https://github.com/JohnMcLear/ep_email_notifications

# Installation
Make sure an SMTP gateway is installed IE postfix

Copy/Edit the below to your settings.json

Connect to a pad, Click on the Share/Embed link and enter in your email address.

Open that pad in ANOTHER BROWSER then begin modifying, you should receive an email when the pad has begun editing and once the pad has gone stale (when everyone stops editing it and a time period passes).

NOTE: You will NOT receive an email if you(the author that registered their email) are currently on or editing that pad!
